- Allow admins to forgive anyone for any hate speech used in their server ![](https://www.jasperstephenson.com/posts/safespace/5.png)

The beauty of this bot lies in the fact that the more servers use it, the better it gets at rooting out hate speech users across the entire Discord network.

## Forgiveness

Obviously, words have context.  
That's why any usage of a word defined as "hate speech" by this bot can be forgiven by the server admin. If the server admin forgives a user within 24 hours of the infraction, the bot will not alert the admins of any other servers that that member is in.  
We also wouldn't recommend using this bot anywhere that a blacklisted word might be used casually and without malice, such as a gay pride server.
